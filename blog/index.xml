      <description>Serverless compute and architecture has been all gaining a lot attention lately, and AWS, once again, is leading the charge with the introduction of AWS Lambda a few years ago. The basic idea is that instead of the traditional model where you run an application on a compute and pay for 100% of the time that the compute is running, regardless of whether your application is actually serving traffic, you refactor your application into Lambda functions which respond to requests on-demand.</description>

      <description>Why would I want to roll my own VPN, you ask? A couple reasons:
 If you frequent coffee shops, or airports, and want a little extra security when using open, un-protected wifi networks If you want to mask your IP address for whatever reason Rolling your own could be cheaper than going with a commerical solution. All you need is a small Linux VM with a cloud provider, and the big players usually have free trials.</description>

      <description>I started learning Go about 3 months ago, back in July. One of the things that struck me early on was how easy, accessible, and fun it was, especially when it came to doing things on the web.
At work last week, there was a situation where an emergency firewall and router replacement would have interrupted communication to a static file server that we depedended on for CI. The solution was this:</description>

      <description>I have been working with shell scripts for 4-5 years now, and I only recently saw, for the first time, someone shortcut the classic if/else/then statements:
[ $condition == &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; || echo &amp;quot;false&amp;quot;  It took me a few minutes of staring at it to make sure it works the way I think it works.
